Time for the weekly update!

Updates have been a bit less frequent of late, as I have spent a fair
bit of the last month on holidays; spending time with family in Iceland
and catching up with friends.

Some Mailpile work got done as well:

1. The Beta III was release
2. A brainstorming and hack session with CloudFleet
3. Work began on accelerating the Mailpile web UI

I also began exploring more seriously the possibility of shipping a
webkit-based container along with the desktop version of Mailpile. This
would go a long way towards fixing the largest outstanding usability
concerns of Beta III. We'll see how that goes!


## Plans for this week

1. More Mailpile UI work
2. Update Beta III with minor bugfixes and improvements

See you next week!
