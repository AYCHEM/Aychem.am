Subject: Licensing: Your Feedback So Far

[ *Note: I'm taking most of the week off to recharge my batteries and attend
the [Digital Citizenship and Surveillance Society conference and
hackathon](http://www.dcssproject.net/conference/)
- the next weekly update will happen next Monday.* ]

There are now **2 weeks left** until we close [the polls](/roadmap/) and
choose a license for Mailpile 1.0. Some members of our community have
written blog posts about what they would prefer, others have tweeted,
and still others have sent us e-mail.

We may not agree with all of the points made, but it's a complex issue and
your feedback matters. Thank you all!

This post is dedicated to preserving and publicizing your thoughts.

> The essential idea here is that I want my projects to contribute back, but I want to do so voluntarily. I particularly want to avoid a situation where I need to implement “special sauce” in a component, but then may have to release that code out into the marketplace- there’s no particularly good reason I would want to take on, say, a virally licensed webserver.

> In terms of choosing feedstock, it’s often hit or miss, but I always look at the licenses before I start, particularly for “scaffolding code” that will wind up being the core of an app.
