This is the weekly report!  I'm changing the format ever so slightly to
ensure the headlines displayed on the front-page and in compact RSS
readers are more informative.

### Done last week

1. Updated the public website. The [FAQ](/faq/) and [front-page](/) content
   was reviewed, updated and cleaned up. Individual [blog](/blog/) posts now
   have "next" and "previous" links. Minor tweaks were made to the site
   design to help with navigation of large pages: an up arrow in the lower
   right corner and a table-of-contents overview of the FAQ.

2. Unveiled [the Community Roadmap](/roadmap/); votable content includes
   the licensing question and the post-1.0 roadmap.

3. Published [a detailed blog-post explaining the AGPLv3 vs. Apache licensing
   question](/blog/2015-05-08_Choosing_a_License.html) we need to resolve,
   publicized on Twitter and Hacker News. Took part in discussions on both
   venues.

### Plans for this week

1. Compile an up-to-date list of backers and their e-mail addresses, for
   sending out invitations to the community voting page.

2. Send out the first 750 invitations.

3. Back to coding: Key discovery front-end and VFS work are next!
