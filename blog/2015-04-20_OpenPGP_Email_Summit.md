Subject: The First OpenPGP E-mail Summit

This weekend I attended the first OpenPGP e-mail summit, mostly
organized by Nico of the Enigmail project, generously hosted by
[Giegerich & Partner](http://www.giepa.de/) in Dreieich, Germany.

At the summit I met folks from [Enigmail](https://www.enigmail.net/),
[Whiteout](https://www.whiteout.io/),
[Mailvelope](https://www.mailvelope.com/),
[Google End-to-End](https://github.com/google/end-to-end)
and many other projects, including our very own Brennan Novak who
presented his [Modern PGP](http://modernpgp.org) initiative and of
course Werner and [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) itself. That was
actually the main theme of the first day; presenting our respective
projects and just getting to know each other. Most of us had never met
before in person and I am pretty sure everyone learned something new.

The second day was more work focused. Common topics of interest were
identified and then we split up into discussion groups to strategize and
identify common problems and potential solutions. The groups I attended
discussed the following issues:

1. A proposal to encrypt or sign e-mail headers (Subject, From, To, ...)
2. Searching encrypted mail
3. Possible improvements to the PGP/MIME standard

There seemed to be a common consensus that there are some very real
problems we should aim to solve together and standardize. As we have
[blogged about before](2014-11-21_To_PGP_MIME_Or_Not.html), these are
issues which Mailpile cares deeply about, so I was very happy to get a
chance to share our experience, ideas and learn from the others. Further
steps will be taken online, in code and on mailing lists.

Sessions I was unable to attend discussed topics such as key discovery,
key certification, key synchronization, next-generation key servers,
terminology and user-facing vocabulary and fostering ongoing
collaboration between the attending projects.

All in all, the summit greatly exceeded my expectations. There was very
little bickering or bike-shedding, and all attendees seemed happy to set
aside their political differences in the interest of collaboration and
improving the e-mail encryption ecosystem.

I look forward to working with all of them in the future.
