Hello!

Sorry about the long silence. I've been so busy writing code and living my
life, that the blog (and the Twitter account) have both been a bit neglected
this year.

However, this weekend, I will crawl out of my cave and attend the
<a href="https://sha2017.org/">SHA 2017</a> Hacker Camp! Sm√°ri will also
be there, and I just know a whole bunch of our backers and wider community will
be as well. In addition to sleeping in a tent and meeting awesome people (you,
I hope) at SHA, I will be giving a talk to celebrate the Mailpile project's 4
year birthday.

Yep, Mailpile is turning 4 years old. Happy Birthday Mailpile!

For those of you who won't be able to attend the talk, a small spoiler: a
huge amount of progress has been made towards a 1.0 release. It's happening,
folks.

I'll post more after my talk.
