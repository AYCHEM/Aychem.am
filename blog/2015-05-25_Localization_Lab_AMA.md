Subject: An AMA with the Localization Lab

Last week's big event was a very entertaining "Ask Me Anything"
session with the folks from the Open Technology Fund's [Localization
Lab](http://www.localizationlab.org/).

It was a friendly and productive session which hopefully helped
strengthen the ties between the coding side of the Mailpile project and
the very important community of volunteers that translate our software
to languages other than English. There were two main take-aways from the
meeting, aside from getting to know each other a bit better:

1. Mailpile's core includes a plug-in designed to help translators,
   which can be enabled with `mailpile> plugins/load i18nhelper`. It
   would be useful to develop this further and get feedback from the
   translators themselves on how it could be improved.

2. The efforts of our translators are valuable and deserve to be
   publicly recognized, just like the efforts of our other backers.
   The Localization Lab folks were going to see what they could do
   to compile a list of contributors, and I was going to make sure
   that list found its way onto our [thank you page](/thank-you/)
   and into an appropriate page within the app itself.

The rest of the week was business-as-usual. We sent out over 1000
invitations to [the Mailpile community site](/roadmap/), continued
discussions with potential financial backers and related projects and
created [a couple of detailed task descriptions on the Hoi Poi
bug-tracker](https://github.com/mailpile/HoiPoi/issues), in case
friendly coders want to help improve the community site faster than
I'll be able to do on my own.

On the tech front, I implemented a "Save this search" feature, which
exposes some of the back-end's automated mail filter functionality in
a (hopefully!) user-friendly way. I also made progress on the actual
roadmap tasks- the VFS and the ability to browse the contents of a
mailbox (local or remote) without having to add it to the search index
first. These are still works in progress and have not been pushed up
to github yet.


### Plans for this week

1. Send out the rest of the invitations to community site
2. Revisit the settings of our Twitter and Facebook accounts. Should we
   even have a Facebook account?
3. Keep on hacking...
