After posting last week about fatigue and burnout, a lot of people
reached out and offered encouragement or support.

I really appreciate it: thank you all!

On the code front things have been mostly quiet since last week,
because I have been trying to get some rest. I'm not very good at
that, to be honest, but I try. In spite of myself, I made some
progress on speeding up the web UI (in my private branch) and some
friendly volunteers from our community of translators have both found
and fixed a bunch of typos.

Grant work progresses, slowly.


## Tasks for this week

Tasks for this week are the same as last week:

1. Not burn out
2. Really finish the OTF grant proposal for real
3. Write some code
