Hello again!

As warned about in our last blog post, development has been on hiatus
for the last few months as I moved to (and from) Iceland, bought and
sold a house and helped the Icelandic Pirate Party prepare for the
up-coming parliamentary elections. It was frankly, an exhausting summer
and I was sad not to have any time for Mailpile.

But it's the summer is well and truly over, and I'm back. Mailpile is
again one of my top priorities.

I've warmed up by responding to a few issues
[on Github](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile),
fixing a couple of simple bugs and reconnecting with people on the
#mailpile IRC channel on Freenode.

Taking a break is almost always healthy for a project, as it makes
room for new insights and perspective.

I'm still in the process of "rebooting" the development effort, but I've
already decided to make at least one change - I will take advantage of
[Github's new code-review
tools](https://help.github.com/articles/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/)
to get community members to review my own work. This should improve the
code quality in Mailpile, while helping spread knowledge and
understanding of the code to a wider group of people - over time
improving the project's
"[bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)". A long-time
contributor, Jocelyn Delande, has volunteered to be my first reviewer,
and hopefully more people will pitch in over time.

More soon. It's good to be back!
