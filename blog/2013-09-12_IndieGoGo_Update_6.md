Dear Mailpile Supporters!

The campaign is over! It is time to get to work making Mailpile a
reality. We actually rolled up our sleeves and had a very long meeting
last Friday to discuss in more detail exactly how this is going to pan
out. And of course [we blogged about it](2013-09-11_Budget_and_Roadmap.html).

Thanks to your generous donations, we raised a grand total of $163,192
here [on IndieGoGo](http://igg.me/at/mailpile/). This is nothing
short of amazing, and we are grateful to you all.

In the final hours of the campaign, we were delighted to have one last
Icelandophile join the group: [Cloudfleet](https://cloudfleet.io/) sent
a cool $4,096 dollars our way. Cloudfleet is an effort to create a box
that makes it easy to host essential internet services at home - and
obviously we are going to get to work to make sure Mailpile can be one
of those services.

To read about the other generous supporters of our work, check out these
