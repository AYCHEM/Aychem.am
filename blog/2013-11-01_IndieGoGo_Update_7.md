Dear Mailpile Supporters!

Time has really flown this autumn - it is November already! As I'm sure
some of you noticed, we had hoped to deliver perks by the end of
October... well obviously that didn't happen. Oops!

We haven't forgotten though, we are just late.

In part this is due to our inexperience managing the logistics of making
and shipping physical objects, in part it is due to the fact that we got
really excited about Mailpile and spent [too much time writing
code](https://github.com/pagekite/Mailpile/graphs/contributors) and too
little time on other things.

Writing code is fun, and Mailpile is going to be awesome.

But perks. We need to ship them. We will be sending questionnaires out
on Monday, to anyone who donated over $23 USD to the campaign to
double-check that the information we got from IndieGoGo accurately
reflects what you want. So watch your e-mail and check your spam
folders.

Also... in case you'd heard of something called DarkMail and were
wondering how it relates to Mailpile, check out [this blog post by
Smári](http://www.mailpile.is/blog/2013-10-31_DarkMail_and_Secure_Protocols.html). 

Thanks for your support!
