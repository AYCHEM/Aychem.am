Hello Mailpile world!

We have launched a new site for community discussions about Mailpile:
[community.mailpile.is](https://community.mailpile.is/categories)

The site runs the excellent [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) software,
which means it's primarily an accessible web-based discussion forum, but it can
also be used as a mailing list for those who prefer such things. Our Discourse
was set up by a kind member of our community, <b>Greg Sutcliffe</b>. Thanks
Greg! And thanks [Ásta](https://twitter.com/asta_fish) for helping me launch
the site properly.

The purpose of the site is to give people a searchable, "on the record" venue to
[discuss Mailpile, provide feedback, exchange tips and
tricks](https://community.mailpile.is/c/uncategorized) - and
[get support](https://community.mailpile.is/c/support). The forum is brand new and
pretty empty at the moment, so please feel free to post something and start a
conversation!

For more ephemeral discussions, we still have
[#mailpile on Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23mailpile&uio=d4),
and for bug reports we have
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues). The Community site
is for everything else.

Including [discussions about our blog
posts!](https://community.mailpile.is/t/community-discourse-launched/31).
