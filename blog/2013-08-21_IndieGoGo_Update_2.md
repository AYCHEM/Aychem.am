as a campaign update.)</small>

Dear Mailpile Supporters,

Thanks to your fantastic support, we are happy to announce that the
project has reached its funding goals. We have raised almost $110,000
already, from over 2000 different individuals and companies!

We are profoundly grateful to you all, and can't wait until next month
when we can really get to work making Mailpile the best e-mail
experience we can.

Exceeding our goals with a full three weeks left of the campaign has of
course raised the question: what do we do if we raise significantly more
cash than planned? We have dedicated a brief blog post to discussing
this topic:
<http://www.mailpile.is/blog/2013-08-20_Turning_Money_Into_Code.html> We
also want to take this opportunity to publicly thank and introduce our
bigger backers to the rest of the community. It's a fantastic selection
of companies and organizations: GreenQloud, Commons Machinery,
FreedomBox, 1984 Hosting, WiTopia and FS Data. For more information
about each one, read on!

[GreenQloud](http://greenqloud.com/) and Bala Kamallakharan broke the
ice when it comes to larger donations, donating $2,048 for the first
PostMaster General perk. GreenQloud is an Icelandic Cloud computing
software company, specializing in environmentally friendly drop-in
replacements for EC2, S3 and DropBox.

Our first Icelandophile was
[Commons Machinery](http://commonsmachinery.se/) of Sweden. Their
mission is experimenting with and developing new technology to make
attribution of digital works easier and ideally automatic.

Eben Moglen of [FreedomBox](http://freedomboxfoundation.org/) was our
2nd Icelandophile. Eben has been working tirelessly on protecting
software freedom and digital consumer rights since the early 1990s, with
FreedomBox being one of his latest and most exciting projects: an
inexpensive home server designed to protect your privacy.

[1984 Hosting](https://www.1984hosting.com/) bought the second
Postmaster General perk. They are an Icelandic provider of affordable
web hosting and virtual private servers, and are known and loved in
Iceland for their free DNS hosting.

Our third Postmaster General is [WiTopia](https://www.witopia.net/), a
personal virtual private network provider based out of the U.S.A.

Last but not least, our third Icelandophile (counted as two Postmaster
Generals, because the Icelandophile was briefly sold out) is
[FS Data](https://fsdata.se/), also of Sweden. They are one of
Sweden's oldest, largest and most popular providers of web hosting and
e-mail related services.

We also have some other large backers who chose to remain anonymous: you
know you are, and we thank you too!
