Happy New Year everyone, and thank you for all the support and good
times in 2015!

This fall, we announced that we would try and get Mailpile 1.0 for Linux
released in 2015. We're not quite there, but we're so close we can smell
it...

## Everybody Freeze!

Mailpile is now in a state of **Feature Freeze**, which means the only
development expected until 1.0 is bugfixes, "sweeping things under the
rug" (hiding features if they have bugs that need more than 1-2 hours of
work to fix), packaging work, translations and documentation.

How long we stay in this state depends on how many showstopper bugs we
find, which is impossible to predict. But the work I know needs to be
done should be doable in January.

Progress is being made.
