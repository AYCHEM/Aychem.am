    <title>Holiday Season Updates</title>
    <link>http://www.mailpile.is/blog/2017-12-12_Holiday_Season_Updates.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy holidays, dear readers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been way too long since I updated this blog. Way too long!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in August, the plan was to quickly post job ads and start looking
for people to hire for our next stages of work - building minimal
Windows and Mac GUIs, and installers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That timeline didn&#39;t quite pan out, mostly because I was distracted by
other work. My &lt;a href=&#34;https://pagekite.net/&#34;&gt;other job&lt;/a&gt; needed my attention,
then &lt;a href=&#34;https://grapevine.is/news/2017/09/15/icelands-government-collapses-uncertainty-lies-ahead/&#34;&gt;the Icelandic government
collapsed&lt;/a&gt;,
so I volunteered some of my time to help the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.piratar.is/&#34;&gt;Icelandic
Pirates&lt;/a&gt; campaign. I also moved back to Italy
from Iceland, which always slows me down for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But enough excuses already!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some intensive introspection and deep analysis of the Mailpile
project&#39;s structure and history, we have identified our biggest problem:
I am a bottleneck. OK, I made that up. We didn&#39;t perform any analysis,
it&#39;s been obvious for a while that this is a problem. However, empowered
by Bitcoin&#39;s latest shenanigans, we have finally done something about
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve hired a project manager!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talented &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Oktavia&#34;&gt;Oktavía Hrund&lt;/a&gt; has been hired
to make sure things get done in spite of me. She has a contract in hand,
a budget to work with and Mailpile installed on her laptop... she&#39;s here
to kick ass and chew bubblegum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have changed ownership!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another recent development, is Mailpile ehf, the Icelandic company
founded around the project has changed ownership. Mailpile ehf used to
be fully owned by the original project founders: Smári McCarthy, Brennan
Novak and myself. Since then, Brennan has moved on to other things.
Recently he sold his shares to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.danielyeow.com/&#34;&gt;Daniel
Yeow&lt;/a&gt;. Daniel should be a a familiar face
to the the speed skaters amongst you (I hear Mailpile is huge in the
speed skating community... huge!), but he has also been helping out with
coordination of our Transifex community while researching whether it is
possible to use Raspberry-Pi-like devices to make a Mailpile hardware
product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You made this happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your encouragement, your belief in our vision and your gracious
donations (including Bitcoin donations) are what makes Mailpile
possible. Bitcoin prices have risen dramatically, so much so that we now
have enough magical Internet money to fund another round or two of work
after this one - assuming Bitcoin doesn&#39;t collapse completely in the
meantime! So thank you again for your trust and donations. They have
given us the motivation and courage we need to keep going and make
Mailpile available, easy and accessible to you all! We may be late, but
never isn&#39;t an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the news for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure Okta will make me blog again soon. Until then, I hope you enjoy
Santaseason, spend some quality time with your loved ones and enter the
Gregorian Calendar New Year full of joy and optimism...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Still Hacking Anyway</title>
    <link>http://www.mailpile.is/blog/2017-08-13_SHA2017.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, I happily attended the Dutch SHA2017 Hacker Camp. I slept
in a tent, gave a talk about Mailpile and had too much beer and almost
enough interesting conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advertised title of my talk was &#34;Four years later&#34;, because Mailpile
itself was launched at the last Dutch hacker camp: OHM in 2013. So I
talked about what Mailpile is, what has happened during the last four
years and finally I announced &lt;a href=&#34;/download/&#34;&gt;our first 1.0 release candiate&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I sneakily changed the title to &lt;strong&gt;Still Hacking Anyway&lt;/strong&gt;, because
I just liked that better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://media.ccc.de/about.html&#34;&gt;the Chaos Computer Club media
project&lt;/a&gt;, you can watch the talk here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;width: 670px; margin: 0 0 0 20px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;660&#34; height=&#34;378&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0 0 0 10px;&#34;
        src=&#34;https://media.ccc.de/v/SHA2017-101-mailpile/oembed&#34;
        frameborder=0 allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;p style=&#34;text-align: right; margin: -10px 10px 20px 0;&#34;&gt;
   &lt;a href=&#34;https://media.ccc.de/v/SHA2017-101-mailpile&#34;
      target=_blank&gt;download the talk here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the talk I gave away a bunch of Mailpile t-shirts and stickers,
but mostly relaxed and enjoyed being surrounded by interesting
hacktivists at the camp. It was a wonderful event and the organizers
and volunteers all did a fantastic job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk ended with a call for help; funnily enough, I&#39;m roughly on
schedule and would like to hire a couple of developers to help me
complete the &lt;a href=&#34;2017-01-30_A_Plan_for_2017.html&#34;&gt;Plan for 2017&lt;/a&gt;. I will
post more details about the positions later this month: if you know
Windows or Mac desktop developers that are looking for 3-4 months of
contract work, watch this space - or just get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A correction:&lt;/strong&gt; I am aware of one factual error in my talk: I said
that GnuPG 2.1 was moving towards making TOFU the default trust model.
This is incorrect. My apologies!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>SHA2017, Here We Come!</title>
    <link>http://www.mailpile.is/blog/2017-08-02_SHA2017_Here_We_Come.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the long silence. I&#39;ve been so busy writing code and living my
life, that the blog (and the Twitter account) have both been a bit neglected
this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this weekend, I will crawl out of my cave and attend the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sha2017.org/&#34;&gt;SHA 2017&lt;/a&gt; Hacker Camp! Smári will also
be there, and I just know a whole bunch of our backers and wider community will
be as well. In addition to sleeping in a tent and meeting awesome people (you,
I hope) at SHA, I will be giving a talk to celebrate the Mailpile project&#39;s 4
year birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, Mailpile is turning 4 years old. Happy Birthday Mailpile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who won&#39;t be able to attend the talk, a small spoiler: a
huge amount of progress has been made towards a 1.0 release. It&#39;s happening,
folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll post more after my talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>A Plan for 2017</title>
    <link>http://www.mailpile.is/blog/2017-01-30_A_Plan_for_2017.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Belated New Year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your ongoing support and encouragement in 2016. Although there
was no &#34;big news&#34; from Mailpile in 2016, development continued and I was happy
to see a whole bunch of new contributors submitting patches, reporting bugs
and chatting with us on IRC. It&#39;s wonderful to have a community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As any reader of this blog knows, my track record when it comes to predictions
and planning, is absolutely abysmal. I&#39;m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I still want 2017 to be the year Mailpile hits 1.0. The project will
be 4 years old this summer and we &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to make a release. Here is how I hope
to accomplish that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, I will (with help from the community) chip
      away at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/milestone/4&#34;&gt;the list of 1.0-blocking
      issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once (most of) the blocking issues are resolved, a &lt;em&gt;release candidate&lt;/em&gt;
      will be tagged, packaged and made conveniently (apt-get install ...)
      available for Debian and Ubuntu Linux users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I will use some of the remaining Mailpile funds to
      hire specialized help to work on the Mac OS X and Windows integration
      and packaging efforts. With a couple of exceptions, I have been
      self-funding my Mailpile work since the beginning of 2015, so in spite
      of our failures to raise grant money, we do still have some cash in the
      bank (and our bitcoin wallets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a release candidate has been published, we will ask our community
      of international translators to finish their work and try and get some
      &#34;QA&#34; work done to ensure the translations are accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we will also encourage other Linux distributions to
      contribute build recipes so we can build packages for them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback from early Linux adoptors will be used to squash bugs, polish
      the code and clean up the translations, eventually leading to a 1.0
      release. Whether the 1.0 release will be simultaneous for all three
      platforms is undecided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think all, or most, of these things can happen within the next 11 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially with your help...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Too Cool for PGP</title>
    <link>http://www.mailpile.is/blog/2016-12-13_Too_Cool_for_PGP.html</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Some kids are just too cool for school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some security experts are too cool for OpenPGP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s almost become a rite of passage for security folks: work in the
trenches, build a reputation, climb the ivory tower, write a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/08/13/whats-matter-with-pgp/&#34;&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://moxie.org/blog/gpg-and-me/&#34;&gt;epiphany&lt;/a&gt; about
&lt;a href=&#34;http://secushare.org/PGP&#34;&gt;why&lt;/a&gt; you&#39;ve
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.filippo.io/giving-up-on-long-term-pgp/&#34;&gt;given up on PGP&lt;/a&gt;.
Suggest we all &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lawfareblog.com/iphones-fbi-and-going-dark&#34;&gt;buy an iPhone&lt;/a&gt;
and use Signal, start giving people phone numbers instead of e-mail
addresses...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take a moment to go ask any young woman if she thinks giving random
strangers her phone number will improve her security. I&#39;ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the experts are right about many things. OpenPGP is &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; and
more recent tools with more modern designs have a lot going for them. But
I still think they&#39;re mostly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experts, by and large, have yet to offer any credible replacements for
PGP. And when they suggest abandoning PGP, what they&#39;re really saying is we
should give up on secure e-mail and just use something else. That doesn&#39;t
fly. Many people &lt;em&gt;have to use e-mail&lt;/em&gt;. E-mail is &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;. Not improving
the security of e-mail and instead expecting people to just use other tools
(or go without), is the security elite proclaiming from their ivory tower:
&#34;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_them_eat_cake&#34;&gt;Let them eat cake!&lt;/a&gt;&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if that &#34;something else&#34; also requires people use their phone
number for everything... well, that&#39;s the messaging world&#39;s equivalent of
the widely despised &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_real-name_policy_controversy&#34;&gt;Facebook Real Name
Policy&lt;/a&gt;.
If you ever needed a clear example of why the lack of diversity (and
empathy) in tech is a problem, there it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compartmentalization, presenting different identities in different contexts,
is a fundamental, necessary part of human behaviour. It&#39;s one of the basics.
If you think taking that away and offering fancy crypto, forward secrecy,
deniability instead is a win... well, I think your threat models need some
work! You have failed and people will just keep on using insecure e-mail for
their accounting, their work, their hobbies, their doctor visits and their
interaction with local government. Because people know their needs better
than you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ridiculous phone number thing aside, I also take issue with the fact
that when our opinionated experts do suggest replacements, the things they
recommend are proprietary, centralized and controlled by for-profit
companies. Some of them (mostly the underdogs) may be open source, but even
&lt;a href=&#34;https://whispersystems.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/&#34;&gt;the best of those use a centralized design and are hostile to
federation&lt;/a&gt;. In
pursuit of security and convenience (and, let&#39;s be honest, control, power
and money), openness has been hung out to dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is short-sighted at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cool new apps may be secure today. But what about tomorrow? Odds
are, they will be &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/2007/11/encrypted-e-mai/&#34;&gt;compromised&lt;/a&gt; by
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/30/investigatory_powers_act_backdoors/&#34;&gt;government mandate&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/17/whatsapp-blocked-brazil-48-hours-facebook&#34;&gt;blocked&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email&#34;&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt;.
Or just dead because messaging is a cut-throat business and the money
runs out. Anyone remember ICQ? MSN? GChat? Sprinkling these new messaging
apps in security pixie dust doesn&#39;t make them qualified to replace e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if I&#39;m wrong? What if one of these businesses succeeds, e-mail dies
and all our comms become dependent on proprietary protocols mediated by
for-profit monopolies? Is that a problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;a href=&#34;https://lmgtfy.com/?q=why+are+monopolies+bad&#34;&gt;let me google that for you&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope it doesn&#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interlude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, if you are at risk, if you have powerful adversaries, follow the
advice of the cool kids. The experts are absolutely right when they say PGP
is too confusing and messy &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; for most people to use safely. It takes
training, practice and diligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So sure, get an iPhone if you can afford it. Use Signal or iMessage. Use
Tor, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/721-TOR-and-Trust.html&#34;&gt;carefully&lt;/a&gt;.
For e-mail, create as many GMail accounts as you need to blend in with the
crowd and not draw attention to yourself; their security team is the best in
the world, let them protect you! Enable two-factor auth, use HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most importantly; if you can avoid digitizing incriminating
information, &lt;em&gt;do that&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis&#34;&gt;Rubber hose cryptanalysis is
real&lt;/a&gt; and it&#39;s
much easier to avoid creating data in the first place, than it is to
keep it secure after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mental Models and Deniability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rule of thumb for creating usable software, is &lt;em&gt;don&#39;t make me think&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means in practice, is software should match the mental models of
its users as closely as possible. If it doesn&#39;t, users will inevitably make
mistakes. If your tool is a security tool, those mistakes may compromise
their security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PGP in e-mail has failed this on many fronts. The lack of protection for
message headers (the subject line) is one, as is pretty much anything to do
with encryption keys (too much math). But it&#39;s not all bad! OpenPGP gets
other things right, and actually &lt;em&gt;corrects&lt;/em&gt; some of the things insecure
e-mail gets wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most vexing things about e-mail, is people actually think e-mail
is &lt;em&gt;already secure&lt;/em&gt;. They just assume e-mail is like regular mail, in an
opaque envelope that will prevent tampering and keep postal workers from
reading it. Encryption and signatures bring e-mail closer to user
expectations, which means if we can get it working smoothly, users won&#39;t
have to think as much to make good security choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing people &lt;em&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; expect from e-mail, is deniability. Deniability
means after a message has been delivered, it can no longer be strongly
linked to the sender. It&#39;s like an anti-signature... which most sane people
would consider a horrible misfeature in any communication system. Explicitly
designing a system so people can disavow their statements and go back on
their word? What is this, a system for assholes??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, all the cool kids in the security world seem to want exactly that.
They keep bringing up the lack of deniability (and forward secrecy) in PGP
as if it were some sort of fatal flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Are security people all assholes? I don&#39;t &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that&#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think they&#39;re quite enamoured with the elegant math, and really, really
pissed off with certain Three Letter Agencies. There is good reason to
believe major governments plan to, or already have been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/&#34;&gt;recording all our
encrypted communications&lt;/a&gt;
in the hope of being able to decrypt them later. Forward secrecy
(deniability&#39;s more attractive twin sister) prevents that sort of thing. But
OpenPGP doesn&#39;t need to provide forward secrecy to thwart mass surveillance.
If we just use TLS (with the right ciphers) for SMTP, IMAP and web-mail then
that does the job just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I agree forward secrecy in transit is a good thing. Let&#39;s do that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s put our mail in secure envelopes, and let&#39;s &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; drive it from place to
place in nice, secure vehicles. Users don&#39;t expect the cops to routinely stop
the mailman and photocopy all the mail, so let&#39;s make sure that doesn&#39;t happen
to e-mail either. Let the mental models be our guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we don&#39;t need or want deniability. Deniability for individual messages
is, quite simply, a horrible misfeature to be avoided. People already assume
e-mail is &lt;strong&gt;on the record&lt;/strong&gt;; trying to change that means going against their
mental models and setting them up for failure in new and exciting ways. The
fact that OpenPGP wasn&#39;t designed to empower assholes is a feature, not a
bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Yes, there are other arguments for forward secrecy and deniability. They
are in my oh-so-humble opinion, mostly bunk. And this post is already too
long...)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making Progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, like it or not, e-mail is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-mail is the most successful open messaging standard we&#39;ve got and OpenPGP
is the best tech we have to secure our mail. OpenPGP may be dated and a bit
clunky, but &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/28/7458159/encryption-standards-the-nsa-cant-crack-pgp-tor-otr-snowden&#34;&gt;it&#39;s a hell of a lot better than
nothing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks like myself, implementors who are not cryptographers, have long been
admonished to not invent our own crypto. Over and over again, we are told to
use tried and tested solutions. OpenPGP is that. It may have baggage, it may
not be perfect, but it is mature and it solves certain problems. Most of the
flaws can be avoided and worked around. If the security community really wants
us to use something else, you&#39;re going to have to step up and provide something
a bit more tangible than rants on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenPGP is also not standing still, OpenPGP is still developing. The
community is well aware that the technology is flawed and needs work. An
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-openpgp-rfc4880bis-00&#34;&gt;update to the standard is in the works&lt;/a&gt;
and there are multiple projects working on improving both the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://modernpgp.org/memoryhole/&#34;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://inbome.readthedocs.io/&#34;&gt;usability&lt;/a&gt; side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/&#34;&gt;Mailpile&lt;/a&gt; is one such project, but we&#39;re in good company:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pep.foundation/&#34;&gt;PEP&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://leap.se/&#34;&gt;LEAP&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openkeychain.org/&#34;&gt;OpenKeychain for Android&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mailvelope.com/&#34;&gt;Mailvelope&lt;/a&gt;, and more.
Even &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/google/end-to-end&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yahoo/end-to-end&#34;&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; are developing solutions
based on OpenPGP. There&#39;s actually quite a lot going on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an industry, we should be
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gnupg.org/donate/&#34;&gt;supporting these efforts&lt;/a&gt;, not writing
and promoting self indulgent posts on how we&#39;ve given up and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and stay in school kids! It&#39;s worth it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
