Not much news, as I've mostly been resting. It worked; I feel better!

In other news, the OTF grant application got finished and submitted, in
part thanks to some well timed and much appreciated help from Karen
Reilly and Daniel Yeow. Now we just wait and see whether our mission and
the OTF's mission are compatible enough for them to fund some of our
work...

[Daniel](http://www.danielyeow.com/) is going to stick around a bit; he
has volunteered to join the team and help out wherever he can. With a
background in mathematics and coaching elite athletes, he's one of those
rare people who both understands cryptography and has the ability to
relate to the needs of non-technical people. He will be starting off as
community manager, helping make sure the contributions and questions of
people on Transifex and Github aren't ignored.

So, welcome Daniel and thank you Karen!
