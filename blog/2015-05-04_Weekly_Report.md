### Done last week

1. Published back-log of changes to Github, including: VFS code, low level
   VCard fixes, improvements to how the GnuPG keyring and Mailpile contacts
   are kept in sync, and various bug-fixes.
2. Merged [a pull-request](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/pull/1035)
   from the [Cloudfleet](https://cloudfleet.io/) folks, which allows the
   Mailpile web interface to run under an arbitrary path (e.g.
   http://localhost:33411/mailpile/in/inbox/).This will make it easier to
   integrate Mailpile into existing web servers and domains.
3. Finished the back-end PGP key discovery code; the front-end still needs
   updating.

### Plans for this week

1. Update the Mailpile website
2. Update the content of the still-hidden community site and invite the
   first batch of backers to take a look. The launch will happen in
   stages, so don't get worried if you aren't in the first batch!
3. Update the PGP key discovery front-end code
