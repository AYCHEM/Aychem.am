Subject: Why so quiet?

Just a quick update, for those of you wondering why the project is so
quiet at the moment: **I'm on paternity leave!**

My wife Emilia gave birth to a lovely baby girl just over a month ago,
and we are slowly figuring out what it means to be parents! It's both
amazing and exhausting. Being a dad is cool! :-)

That said... I love my work too much to just stop, and I do still want
to get a first "release quality release" done within the next month or
so. So in between nappy-changes, soothing walks and food preparation, I
have also done a fair bit of hacking. Next time I find the time to push
updates to Github (not promising when, but soon...), I'll be releasing
the following new features:

<ul class="square">
<li>A new message view; the current GMail-like conversation view is
    being replaced with message displays inline inside the search
    results, to facilitate navigation between threads and tagging.</li>
<li>Proper support for HTML e-mails, including images and remembered
    per-sender preferences.</li>
<li>Drastically improved thread support and navigation.</li>
<li>Lots of little bug-fixes.</li>
</ul>

Also in the pipe-line are a revamped composer (which also fits inline
in the search result page) and support for PGP Memory Hole protected
headers. However, I doubt those will get done before I impose a feature
freeze on myself and switch to bugfix-and-stabalize mode.

I'd like to send a shout-out to our friendly competitors at
[Whiteout](https://whiteout.io/) - they gave me some very useful
pointers on how to handle HTML mail, and I took some inspiration from
code they have published.

In other news, this weekend I will take leave from my paternity leave to
attend the 2nd PGP e-mail summit, this time in Zurich. I expect there
will be some PGP and memory-hole related hacking taking place at the
same time.

That's all for now... have a good December, everyone!
