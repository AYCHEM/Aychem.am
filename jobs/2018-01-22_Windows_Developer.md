Subject: Windows Developer
Author: Oktavía Hrund
Date: January 22, 2018
Deadline: February 14, 2018
Type: jobs

Mailpile is looking for a software developer to join a team looking to
grow towards more diversity. Your job would be to look out for the needs
of Mailpile users on Windows, write Windows-specific Mailpile code
(user-interface and system integration) and automate the packaging of
Mailpile and its dependencies for easy installation of Mailpile 1.0 on
Windows.

Mailpile is an e-mail client. It runs on your desktop or laptop computer
and you interact with it by using your web browser. The goal of Mailpile
is to allow people to use e-mail in a more independent, secure and
private manner.  Mailpile builds upon Tor and GnuPG and is mostly
written in Python and HTML5.  We are a small company, founded around an
IndieGoGo crowdfunding campaign in 2013. The business has never taken
outside investment and work is entirely funded by contributions from
backers around the world. The goal of the business is to make Mailpile a
viable, sustainable project which is available to as many people as
possible.


### What we offer

   1. A competitive (European) salary
   2. Be a part of a small team passionate about usability, Free Software
      and privacy
   3. Be a part of the development team of a new, awesome tool that allows
      even non-technical users to host their own personal secure webmail!
   4. Be a part of a community!


### Qualifications, background and experience

We imagine you have at least 3 years of experience with programming, and
experience with a similar project, i.e. have you written and packaged
software for Windows? We wanna hear about it! You are comfortable working
remotely and appreciate team communication as important. The biggest
challenge you will face is that this is a complex packaging task – it
involves the Tor daemon, GnuPG and Python – if you are excited about a
challenge of this kind we would love to hear from you!


#### Must haves

Any experience with Python as well as a good record of following project
goals and benchmarks.


#### Nice to haves

Experience with Tor and if you have experience with packaging for the
Windows platforms even better! We would also love if you have experience
working with and in diverse teams.


#### Location: mostly the internet

We are looking for you if you are willing – even excited about working
remotely. The current team is based in Europe, so the only condition we
make is that you could make time for team meetings up to 1-2 times a
week within flexible CET working hours.  There will be opportunities to
travel for team meetings at special events.

#### Remuneration and duration of contract

We are looking for a person who is interested in doing a short-term
consultancy contract within the tight scope of the project tasks as
listed above. There may be a possibility of an extension of scope and
consultancy depending on project developments and the outcomes of this
contract.

We are expecting the duration of the contract to be approximately 3-4
months at roughly full-time.  The project is open to spreading the
approximate contract duration to allow flexibility in working schedule
(to accommodate family life for example).
